# Notes on TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language built on top of JavaScript to give it additional features, primarily giving it the ability to add types to variables.

JavaScript is loosely typed and TypeScript is strongly typed as you are unable to change a variable's type after type-casting them.

## Benefits of TypeScript

1. TypeScript allows developer to define types for variables, parameters, and return values.

2. TypeScript provides better IDE features like autocompletion and code hints since IDEs can use the Type to provide better suggestions.

3. TypeScript code is generally easier to read, maintain, and scale.

4. TypeScript static typing allows developers to easily catch common type-related errors during development rather than at runtime.

5. TypeScript is compatible with any valid JavaScript code so it can easily be adopted into existing code bases without having to rewrite all at once.

6. TypeScript has a large and active community with many libraries, frameworks, and tools developed specifically with TypeScript.

7. TypeScript is backwards compatible and can be compiled to older versions of JavaScript.
